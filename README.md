# what
gmsc - go music select client. This is quick select mpd client written in go. It is ncurses based and is extreamly simple.

# why
## quick select
I (in almost all cases) do not listen to tracks but to albums. I wanted to have a mpd client that would, with as minimal key presses as possible, allow me to choose music. This client first shows list of artists, you choose one and then albums from this artist are shown. You choose one and the music starts playing.

## go
I belive in learning by doing. So because of the above, I started to learn go by writng gmsc. It probably violates idiomatic GO in every way possible but I will rewrite it and refactor it everytime I see that something can be done more GO'ish. This is mainly educational project.
